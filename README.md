# CollegeBinder
The premier application to finding data on colleges and universities in the United States.

# Why CollegeBinder?
Across the nation, millions of students, teachers, and leaders alike have their eyes focused on the top 
Universities in the nation for innovation and higher education. For many upcoming college students in the country,
the decision to choose which college to attend can be a tough one, with so much information and conflicting opinions
on each school --  or lack thereof. 

That's why we wanted to make CollegeBinder. CollegeBinder is an informational app to provide to the public
a simple, easily accessible way to find information on colleges in order to make better informed decisions
about colleges for any reason.

With CollegeBinder, we hope to make the decision of selecting a college less intimidating.

# How does it work?
CollegeBinder uses The U.S. Department of Education's API "College Scorecard" to access and display information on colleges throughout the nation.
